xmrMiner - A CUDA based miner for Monero

This project is forked from [KlausT's](https://github.com/KlausT/ccminer-cryptonight) ccminer version.
ccminer is developed by Christian Buchner's &amp; Christian H.'s and modified by tsiv for Cryptonight mining.

**This reposetory contains only the Windows 64bit binaries for the project xmrMiner.** 

There are two binaries available:
  - `xmrMiner_VERSION.exe` is static linked against CUDA8
  - `xmrMiner_VERSION_dyn.exe` is dynamic linked against CUDA8 

# Source Code

The source code for the binaries can be found under [https://github.com/xmrMiner/xmrMiner](https://github.com/xmrMiner/xmrMiner)

# Performance

please read the [original document](https://github.com/xmrMiner/xmrMiner/blob/master/README.md)

# Donation

By default xmrMiner will donate 2% of the shares to my Monero address.
If you want to change that, use the runtime option `--donate` to de/increase the donation.
If you find this tool useful and like to support its continued development, then consider a donation.
Do not forget the original authors.
